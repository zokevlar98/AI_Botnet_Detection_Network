# Botnet Detection using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project implements a machine learning-based approach to detect active botnets in network traffic using the CTU-13 dataset. Botnets are networks of compromised computers controlled by malicious actors, and their detection is crucial for network security.

## Project Goal
Develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of identifying botnet activity in network traffic with high accuracy using both supervised and unsupervised approaches.
